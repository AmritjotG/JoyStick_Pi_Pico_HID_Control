# JoyStick_Pi_Pico_HID_Control
Utilized a raspberry pi pico to interface with any computer such that a joystick could be used as an input device replacement for a mouse. The code is based in Circuit Python, a subset of python that can make use of the HID Library by AdaFruit, this library is what allows for the input information to be turned into if statements and outputted as the relevant movements in the computer

The foot-operated mouse represents a remarkable achievement in the field of computer accessibility. We are content with how we formulated our idea with the engineering process. Some of these processes included concept generations, which involved many design iterations, before moving on to the rapid prototyping of our design and assembling it. We further set up engineering requirements and marketing requirements to complement our customer's requirements. We further expanded on this by creating acceptance, integration, and unit tests so we could continue to develop and mitigate any imperfections with our product. 

The process of building a product is an essential part of any engineering project, and it often involves the acquisition of various skills and knowledge. During the development and duration of this particular build, the group learned several key lessons that were crucial for success. One of the most important skills that were developed was collaboration. This project required frequent communication among the team members, weekly calls, and coordination to ensure that everyone was on the same page. The iterative process of designing and drawing was another critical aspect that required multiple attempts to achieve the final product. This process taught the team the value of refining ideas and continuously iterating until the desired outcome was reached.
Technical knowledge was another significant skill that was gained through this project. SolidWorks was used in the physical design where ergonomics and ease of use were a priority. The electronics and software principles used to create the final product were based on the Raspberry Pi Pico architecture, where Micro-Python was used.
 
Finally, the most important lesson learned from this project was prioritizing accessibility. The team placed the needs of users with physical limitations at the forefront of the design process. This emphasis on accessibility required the team to take into account the unique challenges that these users face and to design a product that meets their needs. Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity to explore accessibility for users with physical limitations, and it taught the team valuable lessons in collaboration, iteration and refinement, and technical knowledge.
